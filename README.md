# Capstone-Two
Independent Capstone Project

National parks in the United States were created for conservation purposes and include 62 unique sites. Out of these spectacular 63 parks, however it may be challenging to narrow down just which to see first. This project aims at investigating and characterizing the different national parks by biological diversity, focusing on mammals, birds, reptiles/amphibians, fish and vascular plants. 

Diversity is defined as, “the state of variety; the condition of having or being composed of different elements”. By identifying the national park with most diverse ecosystem, this information can be used to determine the best park to see larger mammals, or perhaps you are a budding birder, or a fan of fauna? Additionally, this database contains entries of animals and plants that were once located in the park but are gone now (historic), whether this be due to migration or perhaps extinction. Therefore, we will also investigate species that are currently endangered or threatened and could impact future sightings at the park.
